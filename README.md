# Green-stock-data-Analysis
## Background
Steve loves the workbook you prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, to do a little more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although your code works well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.
In this challenge, you’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written analysis that explains your findings.
Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. When refactoring code, you aren’t adding new functionality; you just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Refactoring is common on the job because first attempts at code won’t always be the best way to accomplish a task. Sometimes, refactoring someone else’s code will be your entry point to working with the existing code at a job.
## Purpose
In this project and analyisis, we’ll edit, or refactor, the Stock Market Dataset with VBA solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect an entire dataser. Then, we’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, we just want to make the code more efficient—by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to refactor existing VBA code to improve its efficiency and execution time. The initial code was designed to analyze a limited dataset of stocks, but now the goal is to expand it to cover the entire stock market over the past few years. By looping through the data once and collecting the required information, we aim to enhance the code's performance, specifically when dealing with a larger number of stocks. You can find the Excel bookwork for responding to macros in the following

## Results 
I. Stock Performance Comparison (2017 vs 2018): ![Screenshot (1)](https://github.com/zainabosman1/Green-stock-data-Analysis/assets/146840228/d94ffcee-6690-473f-b039-b5e92544ed03)

In the initial analysis, the code successfully provided insights into the stock performance for the years 2017 and 2018. By examining the opening and closing prices, as well as the total volume traded, we were able to assess the overall trends for individual stocks.

II. Execution Time Comparison:
To determine the impact of code refactoring on execution time, we performed a comparison between the original script and the refactored version. The results are as follows:

1. Original Script Execution Time:
When running the original script on a dataset with a limited number of stocks, the execution time was reasonable. However, concerns arose regarding its scalability when applied to thousands of stocks. The processing time increased significantly, potentially impacting the overall efficiency of the analysis.

2. Refactored Script Execution Time:
After refactoring the code to optimize its efficiency, we observed a notable improvement in execution time. By looping through the data just once, we were able to collect the required information for all stocks, regardless of the dataset's size. This optimization resulted in a much faster execution time, enabling quicker analysis and improved user experience.

## Summary
Refactoring code offers several advantages in terms of code efficiency and maintainability. By optimizing existing code, we can achieve the following benefits:

1. Improved Performance: Refactoring helps streamline the code, reducing unnecessary steps and operations. This results in faster execution times, making the analysis more efficient and responsive, especially when dealing with larger datasets.

2. Scalability: Refactored code is designed to handle a broader range of scenarios, making it easier to scale up for more significant datasets or additional functionality. This ensures that the code remains adaptable and can accommodate future requirements.

3. Enhanced Readability: Refactoring allows for the improvement of code logic and organization. By simplifying the code structure and using clearer variable names and comments, it becomes easier for other users to understand and maintain the code.

However, there are a few potential disadvantages to consider:

1. Time and Effort: Refactoring code requires additional time and effort, especially when modifying existing code written by others. It involves analyzing the existing code, identifying areas for improvement, and implementing changes. This process can be time-consuming and may introduce new bugs if not done carefully.

2. Compatibility: When refactoring code, compatibility with existing systems or dependencies needs to be considered. Any changes made must not disrupt the functionality of other components or cause compatibility issues with external systems.

In conclusion, refactoring code is a valuable practice that allows for the optimization and improvement of existing code. It offers advantages such as improved performance, scalability, and enhanced readability. However, it also requires careful consideration of potential disadvantages such as the time and effort involved and the need for compatibility with existing systems. Overall, refactoring code is an essential part of the coding process, ensuring that code remains efficient, maintainable, and adaptable to changing requirements.
